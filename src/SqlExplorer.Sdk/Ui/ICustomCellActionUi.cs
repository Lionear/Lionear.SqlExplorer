/// later open the referenced row — both are the same "recognise a cell, open a provider dialog" shape, so
/// the host needs no per-feature wiring. Additive optional-interface check (no host API bump), same
/// precedent as <see cref="ICustomNodeInfoUi"/>. This assembly and Avalonia are shared across the plugin
/// ALC boundary, so the returned control has a single type identity with the host.
